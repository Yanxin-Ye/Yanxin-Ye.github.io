# How to Build Your First AI Agent

Building an AI agent may sound complex, but with modern tools like large language models (LLMs) and APIs, you can create a simple agent that **answers questions, retrieves data, or performs tasks** in just a few steps.

---

## 1. Define the Purpose

Before writing code, decide what your agent should do. Examples:

- Answer questions about your companyâ€™s data
- Automate a repetitive workflow
- Provide recommendations based on user input

Having a clear goal ensures your AI agent stays focused.

## 2. Choose a Model

For most first-time AI agents, **LLMs** like GPT or open-source alternatives are ideal.  
- Hosted APIs (OpenAI, Azure, etc.) simplify deployment  
- Open-source models (LLaMA, MPT, Falcon) can be self-hosted

## 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

**Python** is the most common language for AI agents. Install these packages:

```bash
pip install openai langchain
